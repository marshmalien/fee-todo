# fee-todo

Create a todo list app completely in the browser. This assignment will require the JavaScript skills we've built up so far: objects, arrays, iteration, conditionals, functions, modules, and the DOM (and using jQuery to manipulate it). It will focus on our ability to work with the DOM and manipulate it based on data in the application.
